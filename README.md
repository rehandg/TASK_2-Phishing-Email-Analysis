ABOUT THE EMAIL: This is a sample Phishing email , Here an anonymous sender is claiming to be from Netflix statign that reciver is having there "Password" expired in 3 days.the link given states "RESET PASSWORD" and in the end concludes the message with a threating tone.




#2.Header Analysis: I used the Google message email header reader for analysing the emails header and find the servers its passed through which reveales that the email is fake.

The EMAIL HEADER that i used:

i have uploaded a PNG and txt file of the header and the result of its analysis.

#3.Sender's Address:netflix@webnotifications.net this address is the fisrt sign that email if fake , the offcial netflix email address does not have webnotifications in it.


#4.Supscious_Link: the email then contains a link saying REST THE PASSWORD and upon opening the link it takes to a very untrusty looking web asking you to enter the account's credentials.
IF we go along with the flow and enter the account details then our account will be stolen.
